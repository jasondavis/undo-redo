undo-redo
=========

A simple and powerful undo-redo stack for JavaScript and all-purpose usage.


Features
--------

- Lightweight (< 1 kb), efficient and easy to use!
- Add any kind of data to the stack (text, images, canvas data, objects, arrays etc.).
- Single undo() call, returns object for new state
- Single redo() call, returns object for new state (if possible)
- Can use callback functions on undo/redo
- Set optional limit (with FIFO)
- Get undo/redo status, count and pointer
- Get or set stack content for storage.
- [HTML documentation](https://epistemex.github.io/undo-redo/docs/) included in addition to source documentation

See the `demos` directory for example usage (or [this online demo](https://epistemex.github.io/undo-redo/)).


Install
-------

**undo-redo** can be installed in various ways:

- Bower: `bower install undo-redo`
- Git using HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/epistemex/undo-redo.git`
- Git using SSH: `git clone git@github.com:epistemex/undo-redo.git`
- Download [zip archive](https://github.com/epistemex/undo-redo/archive/master.zip) and extract.


Usage
-----

Include script, create an instance:
```javascript
var stack = new UndoRedo();
```

Add some states to the stack:
```javascript
stack.add(myCurrentData);   // push data to stack, each add is one undo state
```

To undo call the `undo()` method. Data from the previous state is returned.
If at beginning of stack `null` will be returned:
```javascript
var data = stack.undo();    // return previous state data
if (data) /* set data */;
```

If no `add()` was called since last undo, `redo()` can be called. The data for
new current state is returned, or `null` if a redo wasn't possible:
```javascript
var data = stack.redo();    // redo and return data for next state if any
if (data) /* set data */;
```

For more advanced usage callbacks can be used:
```javascript
var stack = new UndoRedo();
stack.onundo = function(data) { /* data or null */ };
stack.onredo = function(data) { /* data or null */ };
//...
stack.undo();               // invokes callback
```

Callbacks can be set via options:
```javascript
var stack = new UndoRedo({
    limit: 100,             // defaults to -1 = unlimited
    onUndo: undoCallback,
    onRedo: redoCallback
});
```
