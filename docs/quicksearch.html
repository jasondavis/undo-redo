Features Lightweight (&lt; 1 kb), efficient and easy to use! Add any kind of data to the stack (text, images, canvas data, objects, arrays etc.). Single undo() call, returns object for new state Single redo() call, returns object for new state (if possible) Can use callback functions on undo/redo Set optional limit (with FIFO) Get undo/redo status, count and pointer Get or set stack content for storage. HTML documentation included in addition to source documentation See the demos directory for example usage (or this online demo). Installundo-redo can be installed in various ways: Bower: bower install undo-redo Git using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/epistemex/undo-redo.git Git using SSH: git clone git@github.com:epistemex/undo-redo.git Download zip archive and extract. undo-redo.js undo-redo.min.js UsageInclude the script in your project, then create an instance: var stack = new UndoRedo();At this point we can start adding states to the stack: stack.add(myData); // push data to stack, each add is one undo stateTo undo, simply call the undo() method. Data from the previous state is returned. If at first entry null will be returned as there won't be a previous state. var data = stack.undo(); // return previous state data if (data) /* set data */;If no add() was called since last undo, you can call redo(). The data for new current state is returned, or null if a redo was not possible. var data = stack.redo(); // redo and return data for next state if any if (data) /* set data */;Or using callbacks: var stack = new UndoRedo(); stack.onundo = function(data) { /* data or null */ }; stack.onredo = function(data) { /* data or null */ }; //... stack.undo(); // invokes callbackor by options: var stack = new UndoRedo({ limit: 100, // defaults to -1 = unlimited onUndo: undoCallback, onRedo: redoCallback });See the tests directory for example usage.

Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; Optional option object (JSON) Properties Name Type Argument Default Description limit number &lt;optional&gt; -1 max number of entries. Stack will remove first (oldest) entry when limit is reached. Use -1 for &quot;unlimited&quot; number of entries. onUndo function &lt;optional&gt; optional callback function for undo(). Can also be set directly with the onundo property. onRedo function &lt;optional&gt; optional callback function for redo(). Can also be set directly with the onredo property. Methods add(data) Add data to the stack (push). Add the data you want to store as a state. You can store any kind of data - the object passed will be stored as-is. It returns the new stack pointer position. A call to add() will delete redo stack entries if any and reset stack pointer to current state. Parameters: Name Type Description data * data object, number, array, ..., to store Returns: new stack pointer position Type number canRedo() This call will return true if redo() is possible. It can be used to set status of a redo button for example. Returns: Type boolean canUndo() This call will return true if undo() is possible. It can be used to set status of a undo button for example. Returns: Type boolean count() Get total count track. Use this to find out if the stack is in its original initial state, in which case 0 will be returned. If &gt; 0 at first undo (no data returned using undo()), indicates that the first entries has been purged and therefor not available. This can happen if a limit() (or via options) has been set. Returns: Type number limit( [limit]) Set or get current limit. If no argument is given then current limit is returned. Provide a limit &gt;= 1. If the new limit is lower than existing entries, entries exceeding the limit will be purged. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description limit number &lt;optional&gt; new limit Returns: if no argument is given current limit is returned. Type * | number pointer() Get current stack pointer/position in stack. Pointer is affected by limit and will never exceed limit if limit is set. A pointer of value 0 does not mean there hasn't been previous states, they can simply have been purged due to the limit. Use count() to find out if the stack would be in its initial state or not. Returns: Type number redo() Redo can only be performed if you want to &quot;cancel&quot; a previous undo. It will move the pointer forward and return the data representing current state. If you call add() after a undo() call, redo is not possible. You can use canRedo() to check if redo() is possible. Returns: current state to use, or null if redo is not possible. Type * | null stack( [stack]) Get or set current stack. If no argument is given a stack object is returned representing current stack. This object can for example be stored (be sure data stored can be serialized if you intent to use localStorage and similar mechanisms). Note that it references the entries internally. The container object structure is to be considered private. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description stack * &lt;optional&gt; a previously obtained stack object. Returns: If no argument is given, a stack object is returned Type * undo() Call this when you want to retrieve last state (pop). The data returned can be used to replace current. If there are no undo states null will be returned. You can call canUndo() in advance to check if undo is possible. Returns: Previous state object, or null if none Type * | null × Search results Close Epistemex at GitHub "}}
